Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class! 🏗️<br>
1. Create a class representing anything you like (a Smartphone, Book, or even a Superhero!).<br>
2. Add attributes and methods to bring the class to life!<br>
3. Use constructors to initialize each object with unique values.<br>
4. Add an inheritance layer to explore polymorphism or encapsulation.
<br><br>
Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge! 🎭<br>
Create a program that includes animals or vehicles with the same action (like move()). However, make each class define move() differently (for example, Car.move() prints "Driving" 🚗, while Plane.move() prints "Flying" ✈️).
